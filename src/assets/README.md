## Required Images for OnBoarding Screens

Please add the following images to this folder:

1. **onboarding1.jpg** (or .png)

   - Illustration showing home service workers (cleaning, maintenance, lawn care)
   - Recommended size: 600×400px or similar ratio
   - Should match the design with house, workers, and trees

2. **onboarding2.jpg** (or .png)

   - Second onboarding screen illustration
   - Same size/ratio as onboarding1

3. **onboarding3.jpg** (or .png)
   - Third onboarding screen illustration
   - Same size/ratio as onboarding1

## Image Format

- **Supported formats**: .jpg, .png, .webp
- **Recommended size**: 600-800px width for @2x screens
- **Recommended**: Use .png for images with transparency

## Temporary Placeholder

If you don't have the images yet, you can:

1. Use the image you attached in the chat
2. Create simple placeholder images
3. Comment out the Image component in the TSX files

## Note

The current implementation expects:

- `onboarding1.jpg` in this folder for OnBoardingScreen1
- Update image paths in the component files if using different names/formats
